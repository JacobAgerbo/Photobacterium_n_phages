Comparative Analysis of salmonid-related Photobacterium and its relation to phages

The interplay between bacteria and bacteriophages (phages) is crucial to understanding the ecology and evolution of both organisms [1]. Photobacterium is a genus of bioluminescent bacteria that are commonly found in marine environments, including in association with fish like Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Photobacterium interact closely with phages that infect them, and these interactions shape the population dynamics, virulence, and evolution of both the bacteria and phages.

Phages that infect Photobacterium play an essential role in controlling Photobacterium populations and mediating competitive interactions between different strains. Hence, phages drive rapid evolution in Photobacterium through selective pressure. This co-evolution between phages and their Photobacterium hosts leads to complex population dynamics and the potential for phage-mediated gene transfer between bacterial strains.

Phage therapy shows promise as an alternative to antibiotics for controlling bacterial infections in aquaculture and other settings [2]. Phage infection can mitigate the virulence of known fish pathogens, like Flavobacterium [3]. Therefore, phages that target Photobacterium, may be useful for managing infections caused by this genus of bacteria in Atlantic salmon. Photobacterium is commonly found in association with salmon in marine environments [4] and fish farms and is a known pathogen in aquaculture [5]. 

In relation to its fish hosts, like Atlantic salmon, it is crucial to also understand its interactions with phages to fully understand the biology of Photobacterium. Phage infection may influence the virulence of Photobacterium towards salmon, and the transfer of virulence genes between strains. As such, knowledge about the phages that infect Photobacterium can provide critical insights into the factors driving disease and microbiome dynamics in Atlantic salmon. Increased study of phages and their complex interactions with Photobacterium will yield a more complete understanding of this genus of bacteria which plays a vital role in the marine environment and aquaculture. Hence, we have investigated the pangenome of salmonid-related Photobacterium and generated a metabolic reconstruction to estimate metabolic capacities for salmonid-related Photobacteirum. Furthermore, we predicted the presence of prophages and investigated their relation to adaptive traits between Photobacterium and Atlantic salmon.
